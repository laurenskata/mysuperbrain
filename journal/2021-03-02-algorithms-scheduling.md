# Scheduling
[[Algorithms to live by]] by Christian, Griffiths (2016)
***
Scheduling is the act of planning when to execute which task. There are many criteria that can be used to schedule a task.
## Quotes and notes
- Earliest due date strategy - The task/item that needs to be completed the first, gets done the first.
- Shortest processing time - By doing this that take the shortest time to complete first, you minimize the total time of completion. If a task takes 5 minutes, do it immediately. It reduces the total amount of outstanding tasks. Of course some tasks are more important, therefore a weight can be assigned. Divide the weight by the completion time, the higher the number, the earlier you complete it.
- One constraint to all scheduling algorithms is the precedence constraint. If a low priority task is blocking a high priority task, then the low priority should temporarily be increased.
- Switching between tasks also takes time. Clearing your desk, setting your mind into the correct setting takes time that is not spend on completing tasks. The name of this work is **Metawork**. 
- Thrashing is the ultimate embodiment of having too much metawork going on. 
  >"When merely remembering everything we need to be doing occupies our full attention- or prioritizing every task consumes all the time we had to do them - or our train of thought is continually interrupted before thoughts can translate to action-it feels likes panic, paralysis by the way of hyperactivity. It's thrashing" p.123. 

  In those situation it is better to stop and write down everything. Get it out of your mind.
- Sometimes scheduling the tasks can take so much time that it is better to do them randomly. This is the case with answering emails. It can take a lot of time to scan through emails, assign them a priority and then answer them. It might be better to answer from top to bottom, or other way around
- If you find that you have a lot of context switching, and therefore a lot of metawork per day, you can use another theory called 'interrupt coalescing'. This is simply collecting all open tasks on a topic, such as answering to emails, and perform all at once during an assigned timeblock.
- This can be taken up a notch by methods such as timeboxing or using the 'pomodoro' method where you put a specific time to focus only on that task and nothing else.
