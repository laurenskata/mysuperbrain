# Board games that I should get!
***
We like to play board games occasionally and own quite a few. However, one cannot own too many board games. This is why I list all the board games that are worth getting divided by category.
## Two player games
- **Fugitive**: Cat and mouse game styled with 50s art. One player is the fugitive and the other the detective. The detective deciphers clues left by the fugitive, in order to catch them.
  - [Amazon](https://www.amazon.nl/dp/B07NDZPRRC/?coliid=I32KIZDE2S4EFA&colid=A13HAJZUPQJ6&psc=0&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it_im)
- **Patchwork**: Tetris with shopping. Fill your quilt by buying pieces of fabric with buttons! If you leave gaps, you lose points. The person with the best quilt wins.

- **Santorini**: Game set in days of greek gods. Each player has to build up a greek island house to 3 levels, but the other player can put a blue dome to stop them. It is like connect-4 but different. The players have different special 'greek god' powers each turn that breaks the game completely.

## Party games
- **Don't get got**:  This game is played passively during the part while everybody is just having fun. The goal is to score points for doing 'tasks' at the party while nobody is can notice you performing such task. Get someone to hit you, make someone admit to something they did, all while avoiding getting caught.

- **Wavelength**: Guessing game with two teams that compete to read each others mind. A team draws a card with two extremes, good person, bad person. Then a dial is spun that decides where on the spectrum of good versus bad the other team needs to end up. The difficulty and fun is that people have of course different perspectives of what constitutes good and bad, discussion ensues.

- **Wits and wagers**: This game mixes a visit to the casino to trivia. A question is posed and everybody gets to set bets on the what they think is the correct answer.
  - [Amazon](https://www.amazon.nl/dp/B00Y0L8FPW/?coliid=I2UYO89U2GO9HB&colid=A13HAJZUPQJ6&psc=0&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it_im)
- **Telestration**: A different take on the classic pass the story game but with drawing.
- **Kakkerlakkenpoker**
