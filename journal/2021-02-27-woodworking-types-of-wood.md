# Types of wood
***
Wood that is used in [[2021-02-27-Woodworking-general]] can largely be divided into soft woods and hard woods. Soft woods are generally softer hence the name. Soft wood originates from a tree that has needles instead of leaves. Trees with needles tend to grow faster and less dense wood. This causes it to be softer.
